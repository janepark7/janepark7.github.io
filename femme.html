>>>>>>> ux
					<p class="research-details">For women just entering the tech industry, it can be difficult to find a community and the resources needed to succeed. New to the industry, most do not know what exists, where to start, or what terms to search for.
				Finding relevant and reliable information for women  in one streamlined place can be very difficult and frustrating.
				Most companies are predominantly male-led and this can lead to feelings of intimidation.
				Ultimately, these issues can lead to the halting of professional growth of the individual, a factor contributing to imbalance of representation.

					I had a really good time participating in this Design Hackathon. It was really fun to get some hands on experience on how to
					come up with a concept, then work on research, to execution on the design of the product with a team. With the limited amount of time we had,
					it was hard to "trim down the fat" of the concept of this project. But given how much time was given to us, I think we did a pretty good job on achieving an MVP.
					<br />
					The improvements that we would have liked to add are features for a "Premium" membership. With that, it would include a mentorship connection for
					women in tech to start out.
