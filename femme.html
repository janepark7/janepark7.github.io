				<p>
					In November 2018, I participated Hexagon's Hackathon, HexHacks. The challenge was <b>Promoting Underrepresented Communities In Tech</b>.
					Me and my teammates were grouped together to build a resource for women that are new to tech to help them discover events and communities
					within their area.
				</p>


					<b class="focus">The Focus</b>
				<p class="research-details">
					Build a resource for women that are new to tech to discover events and communities in their area.
				</p>

				<b class="problem">The Problem</b>
					<p class="research-details">For women just entering the tech industry, it can be difficult to find a community and the resources needed to succeed. New to the industry, most do not know what exists, where to start, or what terms to search for.
				Finding relevant and reliable information for women  in one streamlined place can be very difficult and frustrating.
				Most companies are predominantly male-led and this can lead to feelings of intimidation.
				Ultimately, these issues can lead to the halting of professional growth of the individual, a factor contributing to imbalance of representation.
			</p>
				<p>
					<b class="problem-2">Problem: Too Separate Platforms</b>
					<br />

					<b class="problem-2">Problem: Too Many Buzzwords</b>

				<b class="research">Research</b>
				<p class="research-details">
					After conducting informal interviews regarding the difficulty of finding events for women in tech, we came up with a persona to represent our user and her goals.
					Some of the themes that overlapped were:
					<p>
						<b class="users">Our Users....</b>
				  </p>
					<ul class="femme-list">
						<li><b>-</b> They  know their general interest field, but not the specifics areas they like</li>
						<li><b>-</b> They need assistance getting involved in their professional community as they pursue their goals</li>
					</ul>
					<center>
						<img src="assets/images/femme-persona.png" class="femme-persona" />
					</center>
				</p>
				<b class="concept">Concept</b>
				<p class="research-details">
					A responsive website with human-based filtering to discover relevant, reliable, women-friendly events happening near you!
				</p>
				<p class="research-details">
					We wanted the search to interact as human-like. Rather than the user plug in their information in
					generic inputs, we wanted to appear almost conversational-like.
				</p>
				<center>
					<img src="assets/images/femme-sketch.png" class="femme-sketch" />
				</center>

				<b class="ideating">Concept Design: Ideating</b>
				<p class="research-details">
					The approach is to have the search be more human than a generic search. The user response will be more
					receptive when the questions and results are phrased in human-like conversations.
				</p>
				<p class="femme-list">
					A List of Keywords to be rephrased on what the user can focus on:
					<br/><b class="no">- By Industry? NO</b> &rarr; <b class="yes"> - By Something Human</b>
					<br/><b class="no">- By Skills? NO</b> &rarr; <b class="yes"> - By Interest</b>
					<br/><b class="no">- By Event Type? NO</b> &rarr; <b class="yes">- By Location</b>
					<br/><b class="no">- By Social Connections? NO</b> &rarr; <b class="yes"> - By Date</b>
					<br/><b class="no">- By Company/Event Sponsor? NO</b> &rarr; <b class="yes"> - By Industry</b>
					<br/><b class="yes"> - By Popularity (community sourced)</b>
					<br/><b class="yes"> - By Audience (size and demographic)</b>
					<br/><b class="yes"> - By Type of Event</b>
				</p>

				<b class="design">Concept Design: Wireframes</b>
					<p class="research-details">
						After establishing the concept of the app, we started to sketch out other screens for them. This is what we came up with:
						<img src="assets/images/femme-wireframe1.png" class="femme-wireframe" />
						<img src="assets/images/femme-wireframe2.png" class="femme-wireframe" />
					</p>

				<b class="filter">Concept Design: Search Filters</b>
				<p class="research-details">
					We started to brainstorm
					<div class="row search-spacing">
						<div class="col">
							<b class="filter-search ">Primary Filters:</b>
							<br /><b class="filter-primary">Location</b>
							<br /> - User input with autosearch and geolocating
							<br /><b class="filter-primary">Event Type (motivation)</b>
							<br />- Network
							<br />- Work on my portfolio
							<br />- Learn about industries
							<br />- Develop my Skill
							<br />- Find mentorship
						</div>
						<div class="col">
							<b class="filter-primary">Perfect For</b>
							<br />- Recent Grads
							<br />- Landing first job
							<br />- Working on my skills
							<br />- Building a better portfolio
							<br />- Meeting awesome women
							<br />- Industry Deep diving
							<br />- Thought Leadership
							<br />- Getting inspired
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="row search-spacing">
						<div class="col">
							<b class="filter-search">Secondary Filters:</b>
								<br /><b class="filter-primary">Date</b>
								<br /><b class="filter-primary">Skill Interest</b>
								<br />- Design, UX Design, Visual Design, Graphic Design, UI Design, Motion Design
								<br />- Software Engineering, Front-End Developer, Back-End Developer, Full Stack Developer

								<br />- Branding
						</div>
						<div class="col">
							<b class="filter-primary">Sort</b>
							<br />- By date
							<br />-	By size

				<b class="idea">Idea Viability</b>
				<p class="research-details">
					<b class="requirement">Technical Requirements:</b>
					<br /> - Web Apps are totally viable!
					<br /> - This app would need to pull in embeds from popular event sites (ie: Eventbrite) and the Google Geolocation API
				</p>

				<!-- <p class="research-details">
					<b class="requirement">Business Requirement</b>
					<br /><b>-</b> Ad revenue
					<br /><b>-</b> "Premium" membership possible for mentorship connection
				</p> -->

				<b class="impact">Impact</b>
				<p class="research-details">
					<b>-</b> Help women entering the tech industries find relevant events, information, and resources
					<br /><b>-</b> Help them get into and stay interested the tech field
					<br /><b>-</b> Keep them encouraged, active, and growing in professional world
					<br /><b>-</b> Ultimately contribute to correcting the imbalance of gender representation in tech companies
				</p>

				<b class="take-aways">Take Aways and Improvements</b>
				<p class="research-details">
					I had a really good time participating in this Design Hackathon. It was really fun to get some hands on experience on how to
					come up with a concept, then work on research, to execution on the design of the product. With the limited amount of time we had,
					it was hard to "trim down the fat" of the concept of this project. But given how much time was given to us, I think we did a pretty good job.
					<br />
					The improvements that we would have liked to add are features for a "Premium" membership. With that, it would include a mentorship connection for
					women in tech to start out.
