					A writing community web app for writers to create, share, and collaborate on their writings
				</p>

				<p class="method">
					<b class="research-sub-heads">Methods</b> User Interviews, Wireframes, User Testing, Prototyping
				</p>

				<p>
					<h4 class="research-sub-heads">Backstory</h4> Many years ago, I was an aspiring screenwriter. I wanted to follow the footsteps of Tina Fey. I wanted to write comedic film and tv shows.
					I attended many writing classes, lectures, seminars, etc. Sure, I have met people but no one I really clicked with or the connection would last as long as the class or the event would,
					and nothing beyond that.
				</p>

				<p>
					<h4 class="research-sub-heads">Problem</h4> Writers who are just starting out, who want to share their writings whether they want to collaborate, want feedback, etc.
					But then, another issue I ask is what about privacy? How can you be sure that your idea or story will not be "stolen"?
				</p>
				<p>
					<h4 class="research-sub-heads">Approach</h4> To answer these questions, I conducted interviews to several writers, some who write for leisure and professional.
				</p>

				<p>
					<h4 class="research-sub-heads">Research</h4>
					To gather my research, I've conducted 5 interviews of writers (professional and leisure). I asked them a series of questions pertaining how often they wrote and what they would look for in a writing partner.
				</p>

				<p>
					<h4>Post Interview</h4>
					After conducting research, the observations are the following:
					<ul class="research container">
						<li> Majority would be interested in a writing partner or collaborate if they share similar interest</li>
						<li> My original idea for building the app was to implement a watermark on their work to prevent stealing ideas or work. But after conducting the itnerviews, it wasn't a concern of theirs.
						Majority of the interviews stated with any creative field, it's bound to happen or people can approach ideas differently. So, I decided to omit that idea of implementing a watermark. </li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<p>
					<h4>User Personas</h4>
					<div class="personas">
						<p>
							I developed two main personas based on user research.
						</p>
						<img class="persona1" src="assets/images/Persona1.png"/>
						<img class="persona2" src="assets/images/Persona2.png"/>
					</div>
				</p>

				<p>
					<h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
					<h5>Indirect Competitors</h5>
					To brainstorm on constructing the app, I analyzed the websites: The Writer's Cafe and Medium.
					<h5>Must Have</h5>
					<h5>Nice to Have</h5>
					<h5>Should Have</h5>
