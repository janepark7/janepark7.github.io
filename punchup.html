				<h4 class="sub-header-project">Problem</h4>
				For writers who are just starting out that want to share their writings and want to find a writing partner.
				Whether they want to collaborate, want feedback, share ideas, etc. But another issue is what about privacy?
				How can you be sure that your idea or story will not be stolen?
			</div>

			<div class="project-details">
				<h2 class="second-header-project"><span class="underline">Research</span></h2>
				<h4 class="sub-header-project">User Interviews</h4>
				To answer these questions, I conducted 5 user interviews to several writers,
				some who write for leisure and professional. I wanted to get a better understanding
				of:
				<div class="lineup">
					<li class="list-items">Who they are and what their current occupation is</li>
					<li class="list-items">How often do they write?</li>
					<li class="list-items">What qualities are they looking for in a writing partner and/or collaborator?</li>
					<li class="list-items">How comfortable do they feel about sharing their work and/or ideas to someone they didn't know?</li>
					<li class="list-items">Do they have a fear of their work being "stolen?"</li>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="project-details">
				<b>Key Points</b>
				<div class="lineup">
					<li class="list-items">Majority would be interested in a writing partner and/or collaborate if they share similar interest or had interesting work</li>
					<li class="list-items">My original idea for building the app was to implement a watermark on their work to prevent stealing ideas or work.
						But after conducting the interviews, "stealing" ideas was <b>not</b> a concern of theirs.</li>
					<li class="list-items">80% interviews stated with any creative field, it's bound to happen or people can approach ideas differently. In conclusion, one interview stated,
						"once you share your story or idea, it's no longer yours."
						The idea of the watermark implementation has been omitted</li>
					<li class="list-items">So the <b>new problem</b> that arose is: How can writers have easy access to other writers with similar interests within the same community?</li>

						I developed two main personas based on user research. I've created one persona Molly, who is a serious writer that wants to find writers that share the same passion and interest as her.
						The other persona, Penny, who is a creative writer who writes for fun. As much as she loves her friends and family, she wants to meet other writers that she could share her writing that will give her an unbiased critique on her work which can help her improve as a writer.
						But is she not too sure where to go and meet these other writers.

					Since there were few user testings, it did not generate a lot of edge cases as I would anticipate. However, I would like to improve on the UI that when the user clicks on the collaborative button,
					a modal would be able to pop up and the user could make any edits if they wish to send to the writer rather than an message.
				</div>
				<div class="summary">
					I had a fun experience creating this app from the ground up. I had a goal which was to create an app that allows writers to share their writing and communicate with other writers who share
					a similar interest and to see if they are interested in collaborating a project.
					It continues to astonish me that something like this was just an idea. I put my idea to the test by conducting research and and visual design to make this into a reality.
