					A writing community web app for writers to create, share, and collaborate on their writings

				<p class="backstory">
					<h4 class="research-sub-heads"><span class="underline">Backstory</span></h4>
					<br />
					Many years ago, I was an aspiring screenwriter. I wanted to follow the footsteps of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dYW_m5I074" class="tina-fey" target="_blank">Tina Fey</a>. I wanted to write comedic film and tv shows.
					I attended many writing classes, lectures, seminars, etc. Sure, I have met people. But no one I really clicked with or the connection would last as long as the class or the event would,
					and nothing beyond that. Let's face it, writing solo is pretty tough. For the days, where it was hard to stay motivated, it would have been nice to have a writing partner of some sort to help motivte you or to even look at your work.
					I'm sure I wasn't the only one feeling this way, so I wanted to put my theory to the test and come up with a solution of connecting writers with other writers.
				</p>

				<p class="problem">
					<h4 class="research-sub-heads"><span class="underline">Problem</span></h4>
					<br />
					For writers who are just starting out that want to share their writings whether they want to collaborate, want feedback, etc.
					But then, another issue I ask is what about privacy? How can you be sure that your idea or story will not be stolen?
				</p>
				<p class="approach">
					<h4 class="research-sub-heads"><span class="underline">Approach</span></h4>
					<br />
					To answer these questions, I conducted interviews to several writers, some who write for leisure and professional.
				</p>

				<p>
					<h4 class="research-sub-heads"><span class="underline">Research</span></h4>
					<br />
					To gather my research, I've conducted 5 interviews of writers (professional and leisure). I asked them a series of questions pertaining how often they wrote and what they would look for in a writing partner.
				</p>

				<p>
					<h4 class="research-sub-heads"><span class="underline">Post Interview</span></h4>
					<br />
					After conducting research, the observations are the following:
					<ul class="research container">
						<li> Majority would be interested in a writing partner or collaborate if they share similar interest</li>
						<li> My original idea for building the app was to implement a watermark on their work to prevent stealing ideas or work. But after conducting the itnerviews, it wasn't a concern of theirs.
						Majority of the interviews stated with any creative field, it's bound to happen or people can approach ideas differently. So, I decided to omit that idea of implementing a watermark. </li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<p>
					<h4 class="research-sub-heads"><span class="underline">User Personas</span></h4>
					<br />
					<div class="personas">
						<p>
							I developed two main personas based on user research.

					</div>
				</p>

				<p>
					<h4 class="research-sub-heads"><span class="underline">Competitive Analysis</span></h4>
					<br />
					To brainstorm on constructing the app, I analyzed the websites: The Writer's Cafe and Medium.
