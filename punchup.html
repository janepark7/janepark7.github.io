						A writing community web app for writers to create, share, and collaborate on their writings
					</dd>

						<dt class="col-sm-3 project-details">Backstory</dt>
							<dd class="col-sm-9 project-description">
								Many years ago, I was an aspiring screenwriter - my goal was to write comedic films and tv shows. I wanted to follow in the footsteps of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dYW_m5I074" class="text-link" target="_blank">Tina Fey</a>. I attended many writing classes, lectures, seminars, etc.
								I even pursued stand up (but that's another story), I have met people throughout my journey, but no one I really clicked with or the connection would last as long as the class and/or event. Let's face it, writing solo is pretty tough.
								For the days where it was hard to stay motivated, it would have been nice to have a writing partner to help motivate you or to even look at your work. I'm sure I wasn't the only one feeling this way.
								I wanted to put my theory to the test and come up with a solution of connecting writers with other writers.
							</dd>
					</dl>

						<h3 class="research-header">Problem</h3>
							<p class="research-details">
								For writers who are just starting out that want to share their writings whether they want to collaborate, want feedback, etc.
								But then, another issue I ask is what about privacy? How can you be sure that your idea or story will not be stolen?
							</p>

			<h3 class="research-header">Approach</h3>
				<p class="research-details">
					To answer these questions, I conducted interviews to several writers, some who write for leisure and professional.
				</p>

			<h3 class="research-header">Research</h3>
				<p class="research-details">
				To gather my research, I've conducted 5 interviews of writers (professional and leisure).
				I asked them a series of questions pertaining how often they wrote, what they would look for in a writing partner, how do they feel about sharing their ideas that there might be a potential of having their idea "stolen".
			</p>

				<h3 class="research-header">Post Interview</h3>
					<p class="research-details">
					After conducting research, the observations are the following:
						<ul class="results">
							 <li><b>-</b> Majority would be interested in a writing partner or collaborate if they share similar interest or had interesting work</li>
							 <li><b>-</b> My original idea for building the app was to implement a watermark on their work to prevent stealing ideas or work. But after conducting the interviews, it wasn't a concern of theirs.</li>
							 <li><b>-</b> Majority of the interviews stated with any creative field, it's bound to happen or people can approach ideas differently. In conclusion, one interview stated, "once you share your story or idea, it's no longer yours."
								 So, I decided to omit the idea of implementing a watermark. </li>
							<li><b>-</b> So the new problem is, how can writers have easy access to other writers with similar interests within the same community? </li>
							 <!-- <li><b>-</b> </li> -->
						</ul>
				</p>

			<h3 class="research-header">User Personas</h3>
				<p class="research-details">
						I developed two main personas based on user research. I've created one persona Molly, who is a serious writer that wants to find writers that share the same passion and interest as her.
						I created another persona, Penny, who is a creative writer who writes for fun. As much as she loves her friends and family, she wants to meet other writers that she could share her writing
						that will give her an unbiased critique on her work which can help her improve as a writer. But is she not too sure where to go and meet these other writers.

					<h3 class="research-header">Information Architecture</h3>
						<p class="research-details">
					From there, I was able to create an Information Architecture of where certain labels can be on specific features of the app and I could plan on designing the
					layout of the app.
					<center>
						<img src="assets/images/ia-punchup.png" class="ia"  alt="information architect"/>
					</center>
				</p>

					<h3 class="research-header">User Flows</h3>
						<p class="research-details">
							Based on the research, I wanted to create a user flow that allows users to navigate other writings.
							When viewing other user's writings, they can also have the option to collaborate which will allow you to message the author of the work.

			<h3 class="research-header">Visual Design</h3>
				<p class="research-details">
					My inspiration when coming up with the design, layout, colors and typography is clean, simple and nostalgic.
					<br />
					<b>Mood Board</b>
						<center>
							<img src="assets/images/looseleaf.jpg" class="mood-board" alt="loose leaf"/>
							<img src="assets/images/red1.jpg" class="mood-board" alt="graded paper"/>
							<img src="assets/images/red2.jpg" class="mood-board" alt="edited paper"/>
							<img src="assets/images/red3.jpg" class="mood-board" alt="edited paper"/>
							<img src="assets/images/typewriter.png" class="mood-board" alt="typewriter"/>
						</center>
				</p>

			<p class="research-details">
				<b>Colors</b>
				<br />
					When choosing the colors, the color palette came from line loose leaf paper from notebooks or notepads. The blue lines I applied those to links and button colors as
					The red would pop in for link hovers and animations. The idea of that came from red pens. When writers
					get professional feedback, it would be marked in red ink. Back in your childhood, in school when students would receive exams, projects or
					papers it would be graded in red ink. My favorite scene from the tv show, <i>Sex and the City</i>, in season 4, episode 17, "A Vogue Idea", where
					Sarah Jessica Parker's character submitted a writing piece at Vogue. Her editor was very critical of her work and made a lot of changes on it in red ink. When
					SJP's character saw her article, she narrates, "There it was, the article I'd put my heart and soul into and it was bleeding." The representation
					of red ink has also been passed on today's pop culture.
			</p>

			<p class="research-details">
				<b>Typography</b><br />
				The typography was a throwback to old typewriter font. The headers and bottoms were Rokkitt (suported by Google Fonts), which
				was similar to Courier New font. The body of the time I went with Lato so that it can be a cleaner font to read.
			</p>

			<h3 class="research-header">Sketches</h3>
				<p class="research-details">
					After reviewing the research and analyzing competitors, I wanted to create a layout where you would be able to view many writings without it being overwhelming.
					I want the author's link of the writing to be easily contacted for users.

					</center>
				</p>

				<h3 class="research-header">Sketches</h3>
					<p class="research-details">
						As I went on, I moved forward to creating the design to Sketch App and improved on the layout, added typography and colors that were inspired from the mood board.

				<h3 class="research-header">Wireframes</h3>

						In my wireframe, I created the outline of how the contents should go together and be viewed on the browser. I used Balsamiq to create quick wireframes.

						<h3 class="research-header">User Testing</h3>
						<p class="research-details">
							When conducting the user testing, majority of the users aid the layout was pretty clean, simple and easy to use.
							The navigation was pretty straight foward. The main critique I got was after the user posted their writing, the success page
							should be able to display a link to the published piece or homepage. Another critique, relating to after posting the writing
							piece, maybe they should be a preview writing before hittting a final submit.
						</p>

				<h3 class="research-header">Take Aways and Improvements</h3>
					<p class="research-details">
						Since there were few user testings, it did not generate a lot of edge cases as I would anticipate. However, I would like to improve on the UI that when the user clicks on the collaborative button,
						a modal would be able to pop up and the user could make any edits if they wish to send to the writer rather than an message.
						<br />
						I had a fun experience creating this app from the ground up. I had a goal which was to create an app that allows writers to share their writing and communicate with other writers who share
						a similar interest and to see if they are interested in collaborating a project.
						I wish back when I was an aspiring writer (we don't have to date that), that something like this was created,
						cause communicating would definitely be a lot easier.
						It continues to astonish me that something like this was an idea could be built into a reality.
