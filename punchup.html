				<p class="research-details">
					A writing community web app for writers to create, share, and collaborate on their writings
				</p>
					<!-- <h4 class="research-sub-heads"><span class="underline">Methods</span></h4>
						<br />
					<p class="method">
						User Interviews, Wireframes, User Testing, Prototyping
				</p> -->

				<h4 class="backstory">Backstory</h4>
					<p class="research-details">
						Many years ago, I was an aspiring screenwriter. I wanted to follow the footsteps of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dYW_m5I074" class="text-link" target="_blank">Tina Fey</a>. I wanted to write comedic film and tv shows.
						I attended many writing classes, lectures, seminars, etc. Sure, I have met people. But no one I really clicked with or the connection would last as long as the class or the event would,
						and nothing beyond that. Let's face it, writing solo is pretty tough. For the days, where it was hard to stay motivated, it would have been nice to have a writing partner of some sort to help motivte you or to even look at your work.
						I'm sure I wasn't the only one feeling this way, so I wanted to put my theory to the test and come up with a solution of connecting writers with other writers.
					</p>


				<h4 class="problem">Problem</h4>
					<p class="research-details">
						For writers who are just starting out that want to share their writings whether they want to collaborate, want feedback, etc.
						But then, another issue I ask is what about privacy? How can you be sure that your idea or story will not be stolen?
					</p>

				<h4 class="approach">Approach</h4>
					<p class="research-details">
						To answer these questions, I conducted interviews to several writers, some who write for leisure and professional.
					</p>


					<h4 class="research">Research</h4>
					<p class="research-details">
					To gather my research, I've conducted 5 interviews of writers (professional and leisure). I asked them a series of questions pertaining how often they wrote and what they would look for in a writing partner.
				</p>


					<h4 class="post-interview">Post Interview</h4>
					<p class="research-details">
					After conducting research, the observations are the following:
					<ul class="results">
						 <li><b>-</b> Majority would be interested in a writing partner or collaborate if they share similar interest</li>
						 <li><b>-</b> My original idea for building the app was to implement a watermark on their work to prevent stealing ideas or work. But after conducting the itnerviews, it wasn't a concern of theirs.</li>
						 <li><b>-</b> Majority of the interviews stated with any creative field, it's bound to happen or people can approach ideas differently. So, I decided to omit that idea of implementing a watermark. </li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<h4 class="persona">User Personas</h4>
					<p class="research-details">
							I developed two main personas based on user research.

							</center>

					<img src="assets/images/writerscafe3.png" class="sites"/>
				</center>
				<p class="research-details">
					After collecting all the information from the interviews, I've observed a couple of websites such as <a href="http://www.medium.com" class="text-link">Medium</a> and <a href="http://writerscafe.org" class="text-link">The Writers Cafe</a>.
					According from the interviews, I want the focus of more how the writings are being distributed and how to connect with other writers. I've created a pyramid loosely based on Hierarchy of Needs.
					This helped organize the importance of what features that are necessary to have in order to execute this project.

					<center>
						<img src="assets/images/pyramid.png" class="pyramid" />
					</center>

					From there, I was able to create an Information Architect of where certain labels can be on specific features of the app.

					<h4 class="user-flow">User Flows</h4>
					<p class="research-details">
						Based on the research, I wanted to create a user flow that allows users to navigate other writings.
						When viewing other user's writings, they can also have the option to collaborate which will allow you to message the author of the work.

				<h4 class="visual-design">Visual Design</h4>
					<b>Mood Board</b>

					<img src="assets/images/red3.jpg" class="mood-board" />
					<img src="assets/images/typewriter.png" class="mood-board" />
				</center>


				<br />
				My inspiration when coming up with the design, layout, colors and typography is simple and nostalgic.
				</p>


			<p>
				<b>Colors</b>
				<br />
					When choosing the colors, I wanted them to be simple and then certain colors to pop. I choose primarily white and black, since the users
					are primarily going to be reading, you want a color to not be so distracting to the eyes. The color palette came from line loose leaf
					paper from notebooks or notepads. The red would pop in for links and animations. The idea of that came from red pens. When writers
					get professional feedback, it would be marked in red ink. Or even back in your childhood, in school when students would receive exams, projects or
					papers it would be graded in red ink. My favorite scene in that one episode of <i>Sex and the City</i>, in season 4, episode 17, "A Vogue Idea", where
					Sarah Jessica Parker's character submitted a writing piece at Vogue. Her editor was very critical of her work and made a lot of changes on it. When
					SJP's character saw her article, she narrates, "There it was, the article I'd put my heart and soul into and it was bleeding." The representation
					of red ink has also been passed on today's pop culture.
			</p>
<p>
	<b>Typography</b><br />
	The typography was a throwback to old typewriter font. The headers and bottoms were Rokkitt (suported by Google Fonts), which
	was similar to Courier New font. The body of the time I went with Lato so that it can be a cleaner font to read.

					<h4 class="design">Wireframes</h4>
					<p class="research-details">

						<img src="assets/images/wireframe-gallery.png" class="punch-wireframe" />
						<img src="assets/images/wireframe-compose.png" class="punch-wireframe" />
						<img src="assets/images/wireframe-search.png" class="punch-wireframe" />
						<img src="assets/images/wireframe-profile.png" class="punch-wireframe" />
						<img src="assets/images/wireframe-writingpage.png" class="punch-wireframe"/>
					</center>
					In my wireframe, I created the outline of how the contents should go together. As I went on, I moved forward
					to creating the design to Sketch App and improved on the layout, added typography and colors.

							<h4 class="user-testing">User Testing</h4>
							<p class="research-details">
								When conducting the user testing, majority of the users aid the layout was pretty clean, simple and easy to use.
								The navigation was pretty straight foward. There were a few critiques:
							<ul class="critiques">
								<li><b>-</b> After posting writing, the success page should link to published piece or homepage</li>
								<li><b>-</b> </li>
								<li></li>
							</ul>
