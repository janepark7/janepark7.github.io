								Hi, I'm Jane! I'm a UX Designer. I was Baker and Pastry Chef for many years before becoming a UX Designer.
								I feel like both worlds are no different from one another, except having the end result being a sweet treat (that you can eat),
								you have a functioning webpage or app to display all of your work to make your life just as sweet!
							</p>
							<p>
								I love creating things from the ground up. It's so exciting to see a product that you started from the beginning turn into something that go above and beyond your expectations.
								I created my first webpage when I was in high school by making fan pages for my favorite bands on Angelfire (shout out to hosting pages of the 90's). After graduating from <a href="http://www.nycda.com" target="_blank">New York Code and Design Academy</a>'s Web Development Intensive program,
								I have learned that creating webpages and apps can go above and beyond HTML (and hosting them on Angelfire).
							</p>
							<p>
								Technologies that I use: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node, React, Postgres, MongoDB, WordPress, PHP
							</p>
