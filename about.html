								<h3>Jane Park is a UX Designer + Researcher. </h3>
								<p class="research-details">
									I was a Baker and Pastry chef for many years before transforming my career to UX Design. I feel that UX Design and pastries are no different, you are creating an experience that involves research and development.
									Finally, when you are done creating the product, your goal is for that person to have an enjoyable experience.
								<p>
	 								I studied Psychology at SUNY New Paltz, where I developed a passion for helping people. I have pursued many fields after college from film to baking to my recent education at the New York Code + Design Academy. It was at NYCDA where I designed my first app that I thought about carefully how might
									a user approach and engage with the product. I started to think about what technologies and products that I use frequently - <i>what is about them that I incorporate them into my life style?</i>
									From there, I have developed a new passion for helping people and empowering them with well designed products and experiences. I have learned over the years that they are the experts of their own lives and experiences and I find that fascinating.
								</p>

								<p>
									During my free time, I enjoy going to my favorite eateries (preferibly donuts), while listening to my favorite podcasts (currently listening to <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-dropout/id1449500734?mt=2">The Dropout</a>).
								</p>

									<!-- I started my career with a degree in Psychology from SUNY New Paltz. I find the study of human behaviors
									fascinating, I want to help people and understand them better. I enjoy listening to different experiences from different people.
									But no matter how different the people and situations are - we all share the common feeling and experience.
									<br  />
									Over the years, I have pursued many fields from film to baking to my most recent education at the New York Code + Design Academy, where I studied coding and UX design. Just like my fascination with psychology,
									even though my experiences were different - they all share a commonality of studying human behavior and experience. -->

									Hi, I'm Jane! I'm a UX Designer. I studied both web development and UX at New York Code + Design Academy.
									I really gravitated towards UX given my degree in Psychology from SUNY New Paltz, I find learning the interaction of human behaviors towards technology fascinating. It makes me want to learn and create the best
									possibilities of executing enjoyable user experiences.
									I feel like both worlds are no different from one another, rather than creating a comforting experience where diners can enjoy a sweet treat after a meal.
									I create user experience for products that users can easily navigate accessibility to make their journey enjoyable.
								</p>
								<p>
									I love creating things from the ground up. It's so exciting to see a product that you started from the beginning turn into something that go above and beyond your expectations.
								</p>
								<p>
									During my free time, I enjoy visiting a lot of my favorite donut eateries while listening to various podcasts around the city.
