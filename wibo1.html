						<h4 class="sub-header-project">Problem</h4>
							WIBO needs to build a staff dashboard to maintain the e-commerce site. The features should include
							to analyze global sales results, resolve issues and communicate with business owners and customers, and
							manage product/services pages.
				</div>

				<div class="project-details">
						<h4 class="sub-header-project">Goals and Objectives</h4>
						<div class="list">
							<li class="list-items">User interviews and observations to collect information to start research process then to design process</li>

				</div>
				<div class="project-details">
					<h4 class="sub-header-project">User Interviews</h4>
						The first step on creating the staff dashboard is we conducted 4 user interviews of current WIBO staff members. We wanted to get an understanding of:
						<div class="list">
							<li class="list-items">Who they are and what their responsibilites are</li>
							<li class="list-items">What features are important to them</li>
							<li class="list-items">What they would like to see on the dashboard</li>
							<li class="list-items">What issues and struggles they are currently facing within their daily tasks</li>

								<b>Key Points</b>
								</p>
									<div class="list">
										After conducting the interviews, I synthesized the data and this is what I came up with:
										<li class="list-items">90% of the staff are WIBO graduates and have their own business</li>
										<li class="list-items">For the WIBO staff, they would still want an open communication with alumni and further assist the next phase into their careers</li>
										<li class="list-items">WIBO's reputation is their main concern</li>
										<li class="list-items">To view sales, they would like a filter system so they can view more specific analytics and sales</li>
										<li class="list-items">Application process is important, they want specific requirements for applicants who can participate on the platform</li>
										<li class="list-items">Dashboard should be user friendly with very little hidden features</li>
										<li class="list-items">Would like to have very little customer interaction as possible but still be able to monitor any conflicts between business owner and customers</li>

								We researched different designs of dashboards for inspiration. As a group, we collectively designed a dashboard and presented them to each other.

									<li class="list-items">We had some issues with terminology and how things were labeled</li>
									<li class="list-items">Some of the modals and overlay we had during the application review process,

						<div class="project-details">
							In our second round of user testing with our high fidelity prototype, we presented to our clients
							and the response was more positive. The only changes they would like to see that would be made was to label the modal when the user go to
							review the applications, so they are aware what is expected to be seen.
