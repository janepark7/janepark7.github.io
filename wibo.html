									<h3 class="med-fid">USER TESTING</h3>
									With the changes of the labeling and path, our second round of user testing was much better with
									less confusion, when it came to the <b>application</b> process. We also fulfilled the requirements of the dashboard that user can
									view sales and manage the activity among the business owners that participating on the platform.

								I really enjoyed working on this project. The biggest takeaway from this project was learning how to have empathy for your users.
								We did meet the criterias that the client was looking for, but when we interviewed our users there was an additional features that
								was missed among the needs of the project (the application process).
							</p>
							Based on some of the feedback from conducting user tests and looking back on my design process these are some of the things
